- Complete static load balancing
    + Send CPU info to coordinator
    + Create a partitioner based on cpu info.
- Do dynamic load balancing:
    + Send CPU workload, thermal infor, RAM usage, and batch processing speed to coordinator.
    + Readjust configs based on this infor
    + Interval for each readjustment? too many cause unneccessary overhead. Self-readjusting intervals?
